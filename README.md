# Blackjack Game (Python CLI)

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python. It simulates a basic Blackjack match between the player and the dealer.

## 🃏 How to Play

- You (the player) and the dealer are each dealt two cards.
- Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- Aces count as 11, unless it would cause a bust (then it's worth 1).
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
- Blackjack (21 with two cards) wins instantly.
- The dealer draws until their score is 17 or higher.

## 🎮 Features

- Randomized deck simulation
- Basic score calculation with Ace adjustment
- Text-based user interaction
- Handles busts, Blackjacks, and draws
